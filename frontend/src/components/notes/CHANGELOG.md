### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### State Management
- Uses custom hooks from `@/hooks/useNotes`
- React Query for server state management
- Local state for UI interactions
- Real-time subscriptions via Supabase

#### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui for consistent component design
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Custom prose classes for editor content

#### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Strict type checking for all props
- Type definitions for Supabase schema
- Generic types for reusable components

### 🎯 Integration Points

#### Hooks Integration
```tsx
// Required hooks (already implemented)
import { 
  useNotes, 
  useNoteTags, 
  useSingleNote,
  useNoteMessages,
  useNoteSearch,
  useNotePreferences 
} from '@/hooks/useNotes';
```

#### Backend Integration
- Compatible with existing Supabase schema
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- File upload support for images
- Search functionality via RPC functions

#### Authentication
- User-scoped notes and permissions
- Role-based access control ready
- Session management integration

### 📱 Responsive Behavior

#### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single-pane view (list or editor)
- Collapsible toolbar
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Swipe gestures for navigation

#### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- Split-pane view option
- Resizable sidebar
- Optimized touch targets
- Adaptive toolbar layout

#### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Full three-pane layout
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Hover interactions
- Advanced toolbar features

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- Debounced auto-save (1 second)
- Virtualized long lists
- Lazy loading for images
- Memoized expensive calculations
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo

### 📋 Migration Notes

#### From Svelte Components
The React components maintain feature parity with the original Svelte implementation while adding:
- Better TypeScript integration
- Improved performance optimizations
- Enhanced accessibility features
- More flexible customization options
- Better testing capabilities

#### Breaking Changes
- Component API is completely new
- Props structure has been redesigned
- Event handling uses React patterns
- Styling uses Tailwind instead of component styles
